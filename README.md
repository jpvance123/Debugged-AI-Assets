## **📧 Why Use GitHub for Image Hosting?**
For **email-based image hosting**, you need a **direct link** to your images that email clients can fetch. GitHub **Raw URLs** provide:
- ✅ **Reliability** - GitHub's servers ensure uptime.
- ✅ **No Cost** - Free to host static assets.
- ✅ **CDN-Like Access** - GitHub’s raw content delivery is fast.
- ✅ **Version Control** - Easy to update and track images.

1. Upload images to this repo.
2. Use the **GitHub Raw URL** to insert images into emails or other content.
3. Example:
   ```html

## **📊 Alternative Hosting Methods**
| **Method**      | **Pros** | **Cons** | **Why Not Used?** |
|----------------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **GitHub (Current Method)** | Free, reliable, version control | Raw URLs can change if branch is renamed | ✅ Best balance of cost, simplicity, and uptime |
| **Imgur** | Free, easy to use | Limited control, risk of deletion | ❌ No version control |
| **Google Drive** | Free, stable | No direct URLs for embedding | ❌ Requires workaround to get raw links |
| **Amazon S3** | Highly scalable, professional | Requires paid AWS account, setup complexity | ❌ Overkill for small-scale usage |
| **Cloudinary** | Optimized delivery, transformations | Free tier limits, paid for more usage | ❌ Not needed for static images |

---

## **💡 Future Considerations**
- If this repo reaches GitHub's bandwidth limits, **Cloudflare Pages or a lightweight S3 bucket** could be explored.
- Potential automation for **auto-uploading images** when needed.
